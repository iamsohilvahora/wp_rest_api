This repo contains the code from my video lesson about creating your first new custom block type in WordPress. Click above on the "plugin.php" or "my-block.js" files to view their source code that you can copy and paste from.

Below are links that I reference in the video:

* [Babel in-browser converter tool](https://babeljs.io/repl)
* [Create Guten Block automated workflow package](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block)
